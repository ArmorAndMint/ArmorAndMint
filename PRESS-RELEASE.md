## Who are _you_? ##
You're a writer. You've worked with other similar products, such as WordPress or Drupal. You're tired of dealing with labyrinthine admin panels that place a greater emphasis on "management" than they do "content". You want a tool that doesn't just work, but works for you - one that makes intuitive sense without sacrificing performance. You want LightCMS because writing can be just that easy.

## Who are _we_? ##
We're Armor & Mint, a team of three students from Hack Reactor. As software engineers in the making, we find ourselves not only reading many blogs to gain insights into technology but also blogging about our own experiences. While blogging platforms have come a long way there's still plenty of room for improvement. This is especially true for those bloggers that aren't engineers themselves. Our goal was to make a blogging platform not for ourselves, but for the world. This is our result.
