###For dev server
> gulp
starts a nodemon session on your server
as well as a browser-sync session on port 3000
- TODO: browser sync hangs on startup
    - you have to stop the page load, and refresh on first load but after that browser-sync and nodemon work great

## Requirements

- Node 0.12.x
- Express
- Angularjs
- MongoDB
