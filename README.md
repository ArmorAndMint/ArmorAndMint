## Usage

- clone the directory using:
- git clone https://github.org/ArmorAndMint/ArmorAndMint.git
- place the bio/hero image of your choice into the client/images directory as a file named avatar.js
- run npm install
- run bower install
- run gulp OR node server/server.js
- Log in for the first time to register as the content owner

## Requirements

- Node 0.12.x
- Express
- Angularjs
- MongoDB

## Development
> gulp
starts a nodemon session on your server as well as a browser-sync session on port 3000
- TODO: browser sync hangs on startup
    - you have to stop the page load, and refresh on first load but after that browser-sync and nodemon work great

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
sudo npm install -g bower
npm install
bower install
```
